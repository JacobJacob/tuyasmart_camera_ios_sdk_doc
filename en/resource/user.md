# User management

Tuya Cloud supports various kinds of user systems such as mobile phone, email and UID. Mobile phone supports verification code login and password login. Refer to [User management](https://tuyainc.github.io/tuyasmart_home_ios_sdk_doc/en/resource/User.html#user-management).

### Mini SDK solution

If you already has your own account system,  need to map your own account system to Tuya's account system. Each account registers a uid in Tuya Cloud, and the app uses this uid logs in to Tuya Cloud to get Tuya device management permissions. Refer to [Open api - User management](https://docs.tuya.com/en/iot/open-api/api-list/api/user-management).
